# Exploration #2: Backend 

*Due Sunday, September 15 at 11:59:00pm*

*Submit through GitHub Classroom AND Canvas*

[https://classroom.github.com/a/vhVyiCE4](https://classroom.github.com/a/vhVyiCE4)


## Overview
For this assignment, you may build off of your first exploration. However, for this one you need to switch between the frontend and the backend,  _i.e._  if your Exploration 1 was based on Angular, CSS frameworks, or something for frontend, then explore something in the backend: Node, Google Cloud, Firebase, MongoDB, etc. If you developed something for the backend on the first exploration, then the same goes, explore some frontend concepts. Essentially select the opposite side of fullstack development. If you did neither of those then pick and choose one of them. 

## Getting Started and GitHub Submission Link

To start the challenge, go to this link:  [https://classroom.github.com/a/vhVyiCE4](https://classroom.github.com/a/vhVyiCE4)

Link your account, clone the repository, go into the code directory, and create your backend application 

Start a new development branch. The master branch will be the production branch. Implement and do several commits. Every time you save, do a commit. Every now and then, merge the code from the development to the master (Every time you get to a good stopping point, for this challenge you can merge after each requirement you complete). At the end, when you are finished, do the final commit to development, and the final merge to master.

At the end, before the deadline, make sure you push the master back to the origin for grading.

**If you work the entire time on master, you will get points deducted.**  This is not a good industry practice.

After pushing back to origin for the final submission, I recommend to go to your GitHub repository on GitHub, download the repository which will give you a zip file of your repo on your local machine, then just submit that zip to canvas as a backup. The submission will require both on GitHub and Canvas for now.

**Note:** If you do not submit on GitHub Classroom then points will be deducted. In addition, if you do not submit to Canvas as a backup, then points will be deducted. 

**Note:** If you work on the master branch the entire time, points will be deducted. Create a development branch and work from there. 

## Deliverables 
The deliverables are the same as Exploration 1:

### 1. Sources

Where did you learn and what helped you figure it out? Provide a link to the topic you are investigating and any resources that help you along the way.

**Help with Decision:** If you need help on making a decision, try to select a back-end framework that you want to learn ... or better yet, a back-end framework that a company you are interested in is wanting their candidates to know. Then go out and learn as much as you can in the amount of time given.

### 2. Code

What did you make? Provide samples of code, showing what you learned. These samples can be demos. They don’t need to be polished; they just need to demonstrate what you experimented with.

### 3. Recap 

How did it go? Write about the topic you explored and what you experienced. This is your documentation. The documentation is a journal-style document that details the stuff you have explored.  You can think of it as a journal that reflects what you learned, the problems you faced, and how you solved them. If you go back and run through the material again or think about the TA reading this journal, it should help to guide them through your findings. Almost like your own personal tutorial with explanations. *If you are unclear what you need to do for this, then please let me or TAs know.*

## Tasks

1.  Create a post on the  _Exploration 2_  discussion board with your sources, links to running code, and recap  **(30 points)**.
    -   I want students to use this for ideas, motivation, and to get involved with the class. 
    - **However, if two explorations are thought to be copied off each other or cheating is suspected, then no points will be rewarded.**
    -   What exactly should be on the discussion board?
        1.  Links to the documentation
        2.  Components you explored
        3.  Trouble shooting tidbits
        4.  Links to your running code on your instance or GitHub
            -   Show off your work !!
        5.  Your journal
            -   The journal should help someone to guide them through your findings and show off how much you explored. Almost like your own personal tutorial
          6. Do **not** post your code on the discussion board
2.  You push your sources, links to code, the actual code files, the recap, etc. to the GitHub classroom remote repository listed above. After the repository is uploaded to the remote, I recommend you download your remote repository as a zip file from GitHub, and submit the GitHub zip file to Canvas that way you don't include unnecessary files like `node_modules`. When you submit the zip file on canvas you will name it `<Pawprint>Exploration2.zip` and submit it on canvas as backup. 
    -   If your pawprint is abc123 then the zip file will be named `Abc123Exploration2.zip`
    -   What exactly should be in the zip file? **(120 points)**
        1.  A folder for all your code, labeled "code"  **(40 points)**  
            -   This will contain the html, css, javascript, configuration files, php, and any other code you wrote for the exploration. The more the better.
        2.  A document that contains links to the documentation, components you explored, trouble shooting tidbits, your GitHub Repository Link, and a link to your running code on your instance (there needs to be some example of your exploration running on the AWS server). The document should be named "Sources" with the corresponding file extension .md  **(20 points)**
            -   For example: `<Pawpring>Sources.md` so if your pawpring is abc123 then the file would be named `Abc123Sources.md`
            - Do not submit a text file or a word document 
        3.  Your journal that reflects what you learned, problems you faced, and how you solved them. The journal will be named "journal" with the corresponding file extension .md **(40 points)**
            -   For example: `<Pawpring>Journal.md` so if your pawprint is abc123 then the file would be named `Abc123Journal.md`
            -   Your journal should be clear, easy to read, and be of some help. If the TA is reading it, the journal should  guide them through your findings and it should show off how much you explored.
            - Do not submit a text file or a word document 
        4.  A folder for all your screenshots. The folder will be named "screenshots" which will contain screenshots of code running on the instance with the system clock in the screenshots.  **(20 points)**
            - The system clock must include the date and time to be valid 
            - You should have a few screenshots with your instances URL in them   
            - For example, you might take a screenshot for each of the pages you implemented running on your instance with the system clock in them 
            - You may even take some screenshots of the completed code
            - The more the better 

## Help

If there is anything unclear about what you need to do please let me or the TAs know. If you need help, office hours are located under Modules -> Course Information -> Office Hours and TA Information

## Due date/time

Exploration #2 will be  **due at 11:59:00PM on Sunday, September 29**.  This includes both submitting the zip and posting the discussion.
